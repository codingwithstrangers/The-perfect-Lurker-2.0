What we want
1. I want to make a twitch bot that monitors activer viewers, this bot will calulate to the hour how long each viewer is watching. to enter the race you must 
use channel points 100 channelpoints. You can move up using items and lose spots with items. the goal is to travel the furthest (spend the most active
time in chat)

How you gonna do this
- Twitch bot?
- Python

What do you need
- twitch bot token

Game play
1. the user doesnt need to do anything but watch, every min they wil move 1 space a total of 60 spoaces (loop)
2. they will get 3 boost that move them up 1 spot (ever bost cost 10 chats)(doesnt start recharing until all 3 are used up(can only be used 1 ever 30 chats)
(chat message must not be spam))
3.you can leave traps for people (if someone hits your trap they lose space equal to the cost of the trap)
4. trap power and bosst power run on the same source of energy. So either you play defense or offences based on the length of time you are watching
5. player actively watching will have color pix
6. users who paid to play but are not active will be greyed out and zzz
7. traps are hidden on screen (player can see their trap if possible)

Visual things
1. 7x7 px screen for player icon
2. 10x10 px race track (1920*1080)
(traps )

client_id = comes from console on twitch developer it is called client id 
twitch oauth = https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ is meaningless
we need token to = mod token and user_token = author token
access token is really your token and you get from access token from here = https://twitchtokengenerator.com/?code=5ufjtyqsgris4pl4f77ebzw4fq1lgp&scope=clips%3Aedit+bits%3Aread+chat%3Aread+chat%3Aedit+channel%3Aread%3Aredemptions&state=frontend%7COUtSUkxyQjBiaEN3TjFENWI0eDRVUT09

Game time
how to score points, pre rec need to use channel point,and watch stream

Point system
1. the user will get .5 point forevery 1 min they watch stream
2. user can get bonus .5 point for following
3. user will get bonus for subbing .5
4.

Losing points
1. by landing on traps buying 500pts (boost makes you skip tile to avoid trap) 3 traps 1 space miniumium apart
2. 


PY Game
What do we want to do 
1. make a mini map
2. put up to 15
3. top 3 people get crowns accordingly
4.the person not moving the most (wrf does this mean) get chain and ball
5. traps on spaces flash red 
6. animation for damage, speed, holding items and sleep

How it works
1. racers in csv will start at starting line and never go into negative
2. 


Version 2.0
1. convert esclient to pubsub (no more webhook)
2. make the bot listen only for specific channel point
